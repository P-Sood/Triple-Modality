Must you be inspired? JAMES: Yes.  I like it for an hour a day.  I don't care if I have to grub for money all day long, when I come home I want it happy. JAMES: I want some kids, I want a family, I want somebody that I can give myself to and Annie is in the center of that.  Now it's just where to find it. MARY: You mean to tell me that you would leave the business over this? JAMES: On this, I would. MARY: Well you don't want to think like that. JAMES: Then help me stay here. MARY: All right.  But you don't want to think like that because what the hell are we working for, Chris?  It's all for you.  This whole shooting match is for you. JAMES: I know that.  Then just help me stay here.

      "JAMES: And then we'll thrash it out with father.  Okay Mom?  Don't avoid me. MARY: The trouble is you don't see enough women.  You never did. JAMES: So what.  I'm not fast with women. MARY: Why does it have to be Annie? JAMES: Because it is. MARY: Oh that's a great reason.  It's no reason at all. JAMES: I don't know. MARY: You haven't seen her since you went away to war, it's been five years. JAMES: I can't help it, I know her best.  I was brought up next door to her, you know?  These years when I think of someone for my wife, I think of Annie. JAMES: Mom, what do you want?  A diagram? MARY: I don't want a diagram. MARY: He thinks he's coming back Chris. MARY: You marry that girl, you are pronouncing him dead... MARY: ...and then what's that going to do to your father?  Do you know?  I don't. JAMES: All right, then, Mom. [BREATHING] MARY: Just give it some more thought. JAMES: I've given it three years of thought.  And I'd hope that if I waited, father would forget about Larry and then we could just have a regular wedding and everyone would be happy. JAMES: But if I can't do that here, I may have to go somewhere else. MARY: What the hell is this? JAMES: I'll get out.  I'll get married and I'll move somewhere else, maybe New York. JAMES: I've been a good son for too long, a good sucker. MARY: You have a business here.  What the hell is this? JAMES: The business?  The business doesn't inspire me. MARY: Oh.  Must you be inspired? JAMES: Yes.  I like it for an hour a day.  I don't care if I have to grub for money all day long, when I come home I want it happy.
